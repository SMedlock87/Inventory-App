Inventory App

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirements and goals were to make sure a user could add, delete, update, and sign up using an inventory application. This application made it easy for the user to use and navigate each feature and screens.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful? The login screen and sign up screens were necessary to allow the user into the application. The home screen, add, update, and delete screens had a button to navigate to each screen and there was a way for the user to log out on the home screen. Every feature and button was aligned centered on every screen to ensure that the application was neat. The designs were successful because the buttons work and the design was simple.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
The process of coding the application is that I followed the requirements of the rubric. I didn't have a concrete strategy. My plan was to keep everything simple and when I got stuck on a feature, I would start on something else which ended up not being a good solution.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I used the emulator to test the application. When I ran the application, it would build margority of the time but there were times that it would not. After I done the APK file, it wouldn't load. I had to change some settings in the program for it to work.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had a deadline to be honest. I wanted to make the application a lot better but I ran out of time. But I knew I had to get this project done. I did get stuck on the sign up screens and notification screens but I used YouTube videos and ZyBooks to help me get through it. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe the login and sign up screens really showed my knowledge, skills, and experience. This project was very challenging and FUN at the same time. I was really excited to see the code navigate through each screen. That was the hardest part for me to figure out.
